#Mothman is somewhere in this small town, our job is to try and catch it.
#Be careful, he might fly away if you scare it. 
#You can use nightvision by pressing " " to see in these dark " "
#I think I saw him fly to the warehouse near the parking lot, try checking there.

#*Missing Mothman plushie Poster* | seems it was last seen near the park.
#Mothman Terrorizes Point Pleasant! | seems it's a newspaper thread.
